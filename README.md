The files:

In the original page, there are three main sections, each with subsections prefaced by letters that start again at "a" for each of the sections. Each sections contains clues that are number consequetively from 1-134.

- preamble_.html: The preamble to the newclues page.

- clues_.txt: A pure text version of the clues. The clues are preceded by their number on a separate line. The subsection headings are preceded by a letter. The major sections are preceded by a roman numeral.

We look forward to the use you put these to.
