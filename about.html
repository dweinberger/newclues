          </div>
      <p class="about">In 1999, most of the media and nearly all businesses were happily and deeply wrong about the Internet. The media saw it as a new way of publishing, and businesses saw it as a new ways to sell us stuff. Meanwhile, the rest of us were getting to know one another, were inventing things, and were having a party. </p>
                    <p class="about">Four of us got so annoyed by the insistence on misunderstanding the Net that we tried to spell it out in 95 theses that we posted as the <a href="http://www.cluetrain.com">Cluetrain  Manifesto</a>. </p>
                    <p class="about">That Manifesto had four authors: Doc Searls and David Weinberger who wrote these new clues, and Christopher Locke and Rick Levine. We four also wrote a book called The Cluetrain Manifesto that became a business best-seller. You can read the entire original book <a href="http://cluetrain.com/book/index.html">online
                        for free</a>. (We did a <a href="http://cluetrain.com/Cluetrain_10/">tenth
                        anniversary edition</a> in 2011 that has all the original content plus lots of reflections on how things have changed.) </p>
                    <p class="about"> Chris writes and cogitates in Boulder. Rick and his brother have Kickstarted a very cool sock company, <a href="http://xoab.us">XOAB</a>. </p>
                    <p class="about">Doc and David have independently written a number of books (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Intention_Economy">Doc</a> | <a href="http://www.johotheblog.com">David</a>) about the Internet. They have also been fellows at the Harvard <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu">Berkman</a> Center for Internet &amp; Society. Doc has been the leader of the <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/projectvrm/Main_Page">VRM</a> parade. Until recently, David co-directed the Harvard Library Innovation Lab. In Feb. 2015, he'll be a fellow at Harvard's Shorenstein Center, and will be teaching at Emerson College. Both Doc and David have families, lives, etc., and like long walks on the beach and snuggling under blankets on chilly evenings. We welcome your comments.

          <p class="about"> These <a href="index.html">New Clues</a> are designed to be shared and
            re-used without our permission. Use them however you want. Make them
            your own. We only request that you please point back at this
            original page: http://whateverlink.com because that's just polite.</p>
          <p class="about"> We intend these clues to be an example of Open
            Source publishing so that people can build their own sets of clues,
            format them the way they like, and build applications that provide
            new ways of accessing them. Here's what we've done to enable this: </p>
          <ul>
            <li class="about">We've put the text of this page into the public
              domain under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/">Creative
Commons
                0</a> license. That means you do not have to ask permission
              before using any or all of the text of this page. So, please do
              not ask us for permission. For God's sake just use it. </li>
            <li class="about">If you click on a clue number (or section letter),
              you'll see a link that points directly at that clue or section.
              There's also some html code you can copy and paste to embed the
              clue into your own page. </li>
            <li class="about">The clues are available for reuse in a <a href="http://www.github.com/dweinberger/newclues.git">GitHub
                repository</a>. (Thanks, <a href="http://davewiner.com/">Dave</a>!)</li>
            <li class="about">To make it easier to write apps (preferably
              Web-based but we're not fanatics about this sort of thing), the
              clues and the preamble are available as JSON and as a plain text
              list. We hope to add some other data formats as well. There's a
              JSON version mounted <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/368662/clues_.json">here</a>.
