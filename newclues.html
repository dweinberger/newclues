Thanks!! — Draft: Jan. 5, 2015</h1>      <div id="intro">        <p id="bigemph"> Hear, O Internet. </p>        <p class="intro"> It has been fifteen years since our <a href="http://www.cluetrain">previous
            communication</a>. </p>        <p class="intro"> In that time the People of the Internet — you and me          and all our friends of friends of friends, unto the last Kevin Bacon —          have made the Internet an awesome place, filled with wonders and          portents. </p>        <p class="intro">From the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">serious</a>          to the <a href="http://lolcatbible.com">lolworthy</a> to the <a href="http://www.truthforhumanity.com/">wtf</a>,          we have up-ended titans, created heroes,&nbsp; and changed the most          basic assumptions about<br>          How Things Work and Who We Are. </p>        <p class="intro">But now all the good work we've done together faces          mortal dangers.</p>        <p class="intro ">When we first came before you, it was to warn          of the threat posed by those who did not understand that they did not          understand the Internet.</p>        <p class="intro">These are The Fools, the businesses that have          by now adopted the trappings of the Internet. They are like unto aging          baby boomers wearing their baseball caps backwards. It's just          embarrassing.</p>        <p class="intro">Now two more hordes threaten all that we have          built for one another.</p>        <p class="intro">The Marauders understand the Internet all too          well. They view it as theirs to plunder, extracting our money and data          from it, thinking that we are the fools.</p>        <p class="intro">But most dangerous of all is the third          horde: Us.</p>        <p class="intro">A horde is an undifferentiated mass of people.          But the glory of the Internet is that it lets us connect as diverse          and distinct individuals.</p>        <p class="intro">We all like mass entertainment. Heck, TV's          gotten pretty great these days, and the Net lets us watch it when we          want. Terrific.</p>        <p class="intro">But we need to remember that delivering mass          media is the least of the Net's powers.</p>        <p class="intro">The Net's super-power is that of connection          without permission. Its almighty power is that we can make of it          whatever we want. </p>        <p class="intro">It is therefore not time to lean back and          consume the content created by Fools and Marauders as if our work were          done. It is time to breathe in the fire of the Net and transform every          institution that would play us for a patsy.</p>        <p class="intro">Make no mistake: We can lose the Internet we          love with a stroke of a pen, a covert handshake, or by allowing memes          to drown out the cries of the afflicted. This organ-by-organ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_the_Body_Snatchers">body          snatch</a> is already well underway.</p>        <p class="intro">We come to you from the years of the Web's          beginning. We have grown old together on the Internet. Time is short.</p>        <p class="intro">We, the People of the Internet, need to          remember the glory of its revelation so that we reclaim it now in the          name of what it truly is. </p>        <p class="byline"> <span id="author1"></span> <br>            <span id="author2"></span> <br>          <span style="font-size: 0.8em">January 7, 2015</span></p>      </div>      <!-- =========== CLUES ============ -->      <div id="clueswrapper">        <!-- ====== CHAPTER 1 -->        <div class="chapter"> <span class="chapternumb"></span> <span class="chaptertext">            <span style="font-size: 2.0em; font-weight:200">O</span>nce were we            young in the Garden... </span>          <!-- ======= section ======== -->          <div class="subhead"> <span class="subheadnumb"> </span> <span class="subheadtext">              The Internet is us, connected. </span>            <div class="clue"> <span class="cluenumb"></span> <span class="cluetext">                The Internet is not made of copper wire, glass fiber, radio                waves, or even tubes. </span> <span class="link"> </span> </div>            <div class="clue"> <span class="cluenumb"></span> <span class="cluetext">                The devices we use to connect to the Internet are not the                Internet. </span> <span class="link"> </span> </div>            <div class="clue"> <span class="cluenumb"></span> <span class="cluetext">                Verizon, Comcast, AT&amp;T, Deutsche Telekom, and 中国电信 do not                own the Internet.
