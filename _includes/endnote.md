#### About

Fifteen years ago, four of us got together and posted <a href="http://cluetrain.com">The Cluetrain Manifesto</a> which tried to explain what most businesses and much of the media were getting wrong about the Web. These New Clues come from two of the authors of that manifesto, and of the <a href="http://cluetrain.com/Cluetrain_10/">book</a> that followed.

There's more information <a href="about.html">here</a> about this project, and about its authors, <span id="endname1"></span> and <span id="endname2"></span>.
